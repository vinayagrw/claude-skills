# Markdown formatting cookbook — copy-paste recipes

Every recipe below is GitHub-Flavored Markdown (GFM) unless noted. The **renderer support**
line tells you where it works — cross-check against §1 of the SKILL before using on a stricter
target (npm/PyPI strip most HTML, Mermaid, alerts, and footnotes). Universal-safe building
blocks (work *everywhere*, incl. npm/PyPI/CommonMark): **headings, bold/italic, lists, links,
fenced code, image badges, Unicode emoji**. Everything else needs a capable target.

Table of contents: 1) centered hero header · 2) badges · 3) alert callouts · 4) collapsibles ·
5) Mermaid · 6) tables & alignment · 7) dark/light images · 8) task lists · 9) footnotes ·
10) `<kbd>` keys · 11) math · 12) diff & code · 13) anchor ToC · 14) emoji wayfinding ·
15) nav bars & dividers · 16) graceful degradation · 17) gotchas.

## 1. Centered hero header (the highest-impact README move)

`align` attributes are the one bit of layout GitHub honors. Wrap the whole masthead:

```html
<div align="center">

<img src="docs/logo.svg" alt="Acme logo" width="120" />

# Acme

**One sentence on what it is and who it's for.**

[![CI](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/acme/acme/ci.yml?style=flat-square)](…)
[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/acme?style=flat-square)](…)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache--2.0-blue?style=flat-square)](LICENSE)

[Quick start](#-quick-start) · [Docs](#-docs) · [Examples](#-examples) · [Contributing](#-contributing)

</div>
```

**Renderer support:** GitHub/GitLab/VS Code ✅; npm/PyPI strip the `<div>` (content still shows,
just left-aligned). **Gotcha:** leave **blank lines** inside the `<div>` around Markdown, or the
`#`/`**` won't parse — HTML block boundaries need the empty line.

## 2. Badges (shields.io)

Badges are just `![alt](image-url)` images, so they render **everywhere** (the universal currency).
Make alt text say what the badge shows.

```markdown
[![Build](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/OWNER/REPO/ci.yml?branch=main&style=flat-square)](link)
[![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/OWNER/REPO?style=flat-square)](link)
[![Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/PKG?style=flat-square)](link)
[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/PKG?style=flat-square)](link)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green?style=flat-square)](LICENSE)
```

Custom static badge: `https://img.shields.io/badge/LABEL-MESSAGE-COLOR`. Styles: `flat`,
`flat-square`, `for-the-badge` (chunky caps), `plastic`, `social`. Add `&logo=python&logoColor=white`
for a tech glyph. **Pick one style and keep it consistent** across all badges. Restraint: 3–6.

## 3. Alert callouts (GitHub)

The current supported syntax — a blockquote whose **first line** is the marker, nothing else on it:

```markdown
> [!NOTE]
> Useful context the reader should know.

> [!TIP]
> A better way to do it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't-miss prerequisite.

> [!WARNING]
> A footgun with consequences.

> [!CAUTION]
> The dangerous one — data loss, security.
```

Only those five types, uppercase, exactly `> [!TYPE]`. **Renderer support:** GitHub ✅;
VS Code ext-dependent; **npm/PyPI/GitLab render it as a plain blockquote** (GitLab has its own
`> [!note]`-style "alert" only in some contexts). Because the body is still a readable blockquote,
this degrades acceptably — keep the body meaningful on its own.

## 4. Collapsibles `<details>`

```html
<details>
<summary><b>Show full config</b></summary>

```yaml
key: value
nested:
  - a
  - b
```

</details>
```

**Always include `<summary>`** (without it the toggle label is a generic "Details"). Blank line
after `</summary>` before Markdown content, blank line before `</details>`. Add `open` to the tag
to render expanded by default. **Renderer support:** GitHub/GitLab/VS Code ✅; npm usually keeps it;
CommonMark passes the HTML through but won't make it interactive.

## 5. Mermaid diagrams

A fenced block with language `mermaid` renders as a live diagram on GitHub/GitLab — no image file:

````markdown
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Client] -->|request| B(API)
    B --> C{Cache?}
    C -->|hit| D[Return]
    C -->|miss| E[(DB)]
    E --> D
```
````

Common types: `flowchart`, `sequenceDiagram`, `classDiagram`, `stateDiagram-v2`, `erDiagram`,
`gitGraph`, `gantt`, `pie`, `mindmap`. **Quote labels with special chars**: `A["a/b: c"]`.
**Renderer support:** GitHub/GitLab ✅; **npm/PyPI/CommonMark show the raw code** — for those,
commit a rendered PNG/SVG and `![]()` it instead.

## 6. Tables & alignment

```markdown
| Feature      | Free | Pro  |
| :----------- | :--: | ---: |
| Seats        |  1   |   ∞  |
| Price        | $0   | $20  |
```

`:---` left, `:--:` center, `---:` right. The **separator row is required** and its colon pattern
sets column alignment. Outer pipes optional but keep them for readability. Escape a literal pipe in
a cell as `\|`. Cells are inline-Markdown (`**bold**`, `` `code` ``, links, `<br>` for line breaks)
but **can't contain block elements** (no lists/multi-line) — use `<br>` or a `<details>` outside.
**Renderer support:** universal across GFM targets (npm/PyPI included); not in bare CommonMark.

## 7. Dark/light images (`<picture>`)

Swap a logo by theme so it's legible on both GitHub backgrounds:

```html
<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"  srcset="docs/logo-dark.svg">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="docs/logo-light.svg">
  <img alt="Acme" src="docs/logo-light.svg" width="120">
</picture>
```

**Always nest the plain `<img>` fallback** — non-supporting renderers use it. **Renderer support:**
GitHub ✅; others fall back to the `<img>`. Also useful: `#gh-dark-mode-only` / `#gh-light-mode-only`
URL-fragment trick on plain images (older, GitHub-only).

## 8. Task lists

```markdown
- [x] Done
- [ ] Todo
- [ ] ~~Cancelled~~
```

Render as checkboxes on GitHub/GitLab (interactive in issues/PRs). **Renderer support:** GFM targets ✅.

## 9. Footnotes

```markdown
Here is a claim with a source.[^1]

[^1]: The supporting detail, kept out of the main flow.
```

**Renderer support:** GitHub/GitLab ✅; **npm/PyPI/CommonMark don't** — they show literal `[^1]`.
For stripped targets, inline the aside in parentheses instead.

## 10. Keyboard keys `<kbd>`

```html
Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to copy, <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> to paste.
```

Renders as little keycaps. **Renderer support:** GitHub/GitLab/VS Code ✅; npm strips to plain text
(still readable). Great in guides and shortcut tables.

## 11. Math (KaTeX)

```markdown
Inline $E = mc^2$ and a block:

$$\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$$
```

**Renderer support:** GitHub ✅ (since 2022), GitLab ✅ (syntax differs slightly); **npm/PyPI/CommonMark ❌**.

## 12. Diff & syntax-highlighted code

Use a language tag for highlighting; use `diff` to show changes:

````markdown
```diff
- const x = oldValue;
+ const x = newValue;
```
````

` ```js `, ` ```python `, ` ```bash `, ` ```jsonc `, etc. **Renderer support:** highlighting is
universal-ish (the fence content always shows even if a language is unknown). Keep one blank line
before and after fences.

## 13. Anchor ToC (auto-generated heading slugs)

GitHub auto-assigns each heading an anchor. The slug algorithm: **lowercase → strip punctuation
(except hyphens) → spaces to hyphens**; a leading emoji becomes part of it as a stripped/encoded
char, so for `## 🚀 Quick start` the reliable anchor is `#-quick-start` (the emoji collapses to a
leading hyphen). Build a ToC with those:

```markdown
## Contents
- [Quick start](#-quick-start)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [API reference](#api-reference)
```

**Gotcha:** duplicate heading text gets `-1`, `-2` suffixes. **Verify anchors** — the linter checks
they resolve. **Renderer support:** GitHub/GitLab/VS Code ✅ (slug rules vary slightly by platform).

## 14. Emoji as wayfinding

Bind a small set to section *roles* and reuse: 🚀 getting started · ✨ features · 📦 install ·
🔧 config · 📖 docs · 🧪 testing · 🤝 contributing · ⚠️ caveats · 📝 license. Prefer **Unicode glyphs**
(🚀) over GitHub `:rocket:` shortcodes — Unicode renders on npm/PyPI/everywhere; shortcodes don't.

## 15. Nav bars & section dividers

A centered nav line under the hero (anchor links separated by `·` or `•`):

```markdown
[Install](#install) · [Usage](#usage) · [API](#api) · [FAQ](#faq) · [License](#license)
```

Divide major movements with a horizontal rule — `---` on its own line (blank line above and below,
or it may parse as a heading underline). Don't overuse; one between top-level sections is plenty.

## 16. Graceful degradation patterns

When a doc must look good on GitHub *and* survive on npm/PyPI:

- **Lead with badges + a code block**, not a Mermaid diagram or a callout (those break on npm).
- Replace alerts with a bold inline label that still reads: `**⚠️ Warning —** don't run this in prod.`
- Diagrams → commit a rendered **PNG** and `![Architecture](docs/arch.png)` it; keep the Mermaid
  source in a `<details>` for GitHub readers.
- Keep the **first screen pure portable Markdown** so the package page (the stripped target) looks
  intentional, and put GitHub-only richness lower down.
- Footnotes → inline parenthetical asides. Shortcodes → Unicode emoji.

## 17. Gotchas that bite

- **HTML needs blank lines around Markdown inside it** — `<div>`…`# Title`…`</div>` won't parse the
  heading without empty lines separating them.
- **`> [!NOTE]` must be the first line of its blockquote**, marker alone, uppercase type, one of the
  five names. `> [!NOTES]` or `> [!Note] extra text` silently degrades to a plain quote.
- **Anchors strip emoji to a leading hyphen** — `## 🚀 Setup` → `#-setup`, not `#🚀-setup`.
- **Table cells can't hold block content** (lists, multi-paragraph). Use `<br>` or move it out.
- **Bare URLs**: GitHub autolinks them; CommonMark doesn't — wrap in `<…>` or `[text](url)` to be safe.
- **A literal `<` or `&`** in prose can start an HTML tag/entity — escape as `&lt;` / `&amp;`, or it
  may vanish. Most common in code-ish prose outside fences.
- **Trailing-space line breaks are invisible and fragile** — use a real blank line for a paragraph
  break, or `<br>` for a hard break inside a block.
- **One `#` H1 only.** A second `#` reads as a co-title and muddies the outline + anchor namespace.
